Hello, My name is Alex Close, a dedicated Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) and Personal Trainer (ACE). I obtained my degree from East Carolina University, where my passion for performance, health, fitness, and nutrition began to flourish.

Hailing from a small town in the Northeast, I carried my enthusiasm for fitness and wellness with me when I embarked on a new chapter of my life in Tampa in early 2023. Since then, I've been actively engaged in helping individuals achieve their fitness goals and enhance their overall well-being.

My professional journey encompasses a wide array of fitness services, including personal training, sports performance training, nutrition, and more. I am deeply committed to empowering my clients to unlock their full potential, whether they are striving for peak athletic performance, improved health, or enhanced fitness.

My approach to training and conditioning is rooted in evidence-based practices, ensuring that each client receives tailored guidance and support that aligns with their unique goals and needs. I believe that a holistic approach to health and wellness, encompassing not only physical fitness but also nutrition and lifestyle choices, is key to achieving lasting results.
Whether you're an athlete looking to excel in your sport, someone striving for a healthier lifestyle, or anyone in between, I am here to support you every step of the way.

I'm thrilled to be a part of the vibrant Tampa fitness community and am always eager to connect with new individuals who share my passion for fitness and well-being. Let's embark on this journey together and work towards achieving your fitness and performance goals. Feel free to reach out to me, and let's start making positive changes in your life today!
